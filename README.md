# Task 1: chatboat
creating a chatboat using nlp to process and analyze user input and generate appropriate responses.
# Task 3: sentimental analysis 
# Objective: 
The objective of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on coronavirus-related textual data using a Multinomial Naive Bayes (NB) classifier. The aim is to gain insights into public sentiment towards the COVID-19 pandemic across different topics, time periods, and geographical regions.

# Methodology:

Data Collection: Textual data related to COVID-19 is collected from various sources such as social media platforms (Twitter, Facebook), news articles, blogs, and public forums.

Data Preprocessing: The collected data undergoes preprocessing steps including text cleaning, tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming or lemmatization to prepare it for analysis.

Feature Extraction: Text data is transformed into numerical feature vectors using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), which represents the importance of words in the documents.

Model Training: A Multinomial Naive Bayes (NB) classifier is trained on the preprocessed and transformed data. Multinomial NB is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem and is particularly suitable for text classification tasks.

Model Evaluation: The performance of the trained Multinomial NB model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation techniques may also be employed to ensure the robustness of the model.

Sentiment Analysis: The trained model is applied to new textual data to predict the sentiment expressed in the text. Sentiment labels such as positive, negative, or neutral are assigned to each text document based on the model's predictions.

Visualization and Interpretation: The results of the sentiment analysis are visualized using charts, graphs, and word clouds to provide insights into the prevailing sentiment towards COVID-19. Analysis may include trends over time, sentiment distribution across different topics or regions, and comparison between various data sources.
